## Preparation

### Mandatory steps

Course participants will bring their own laptops with installed versions of [R](https://www.r-project.org), [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio), and [Git](https://git-scm.com):

1. [Download](https://cloud.r-project.org) and install R:
 - Windows: Click on "Download R for Windows", then click on "base", then click on the Download link.
 - macOS: Click on "Download R for macOS", then under "Latest release:" click on R-X.X.X-arm64.pkg or R-X.X.X-x86_64.pkg for Apple silicon (M1/M2) or older Intel Macs, respectively.
 - Linux: Click on "Download R for Linux" and choose your distribution for more information on installing R for your setup.
2. [Download](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop) and install RStudio.
3. Install Git using the following [instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html).
4. If you don’t already have one, don't forget to create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

**If you are new to R and RStudio, we recommend you to follow the 90-minute video tutorial [Introduction to R and RStudio](https://youtu.be/lL0s1coNtRk).**

### Optional steps

The following preparation steps are optional. You will also have time during the course to complete these steps.

1. Make sure RStudio knows about Git by following the corresponding section [here](https://sites.northwestern.edu/researchcomputing/using-git-and-github-with-r-rstudio/).
2. Install the `usethis` package for R using the following command: `install.packages("usethis")`
3. Set up Git using the following command:
`usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.org")`
4. Generate a personal access token (PAT) and store your PAT as described in Section 9.3 and 9.4 [here](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat.html#get-a-pat).

### Required packages

To work on the exercises, course participants have to install the following packages:

- `usethis` - Workflow package
- `gitcreds` - Queries Git credentials from R
- `here` - Easy file referencing
- `tidyverse` - A set of packages
- `medicaldata` - Medical data sets
- `cowplot` - Features to create publication-quality figures

Simply type `install.packages("packagename")`, but RStudio will ask you about it as well if you want to load a package that you haven't installed yet.
